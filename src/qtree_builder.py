        Generated Assertion: {generated}
        Reference Assertion: {reference}
        
        Key SVA Grammar Elements:
        1. Clock and Reset Control
           - @(posedge clk) - Assertions are sampled at positive clock edge
           - disable iff (tb_reset) - Disables assertion checking during reset

        2. Logical Operators
           - && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT) for boolean logic
           - | - Reduction OR (e.g., |tb_req checks if any bit is 1)
           - & - Bitwise AND for masking operations

        3. Comparison Operators
           - === - Case equality (4-state comparison, includes X and Z)
           - !== - Case inequality
           - ==, != - Logical equality/inequality
           - <, >, <=, >= - Relational operators

        4. Temporal Operators
           - |-> - Overlapping implication (if antecedent then consequent in same cycle)
           - |=> - Non-overlapping implication (would be antecedent then consequent in next cycle)
           - ##[n:m] - Cycle delay range (n to m cycles)
           - ##[0:$] - Eventually (from now to infinity)
           - strong() - Strong sequence (must complete)

        5. Special SVA Functions
           - $onehot() - Checks if exactly one bit is high
           - $onehot0() - Checks if zero or one bit is high

** Analysis Focus: $#$Cover DIFFERENT aspects: {keyword_list}$#$

Context: You have been provided with:
* Generated assertion that may have errors
* Reference assertion that is correct
* Analysis keywords: {keyword_list}

Your Goal:
- Generate EXACTLY {self.max_questions_per_level} exploratory questions about assertion differences
- Each question MUST focus on a DIFFERENT aspect from: {keyword_list}
- Question 1: Focus on {selected_keywords[0] if len(selected_keywords) > 0 else 'operators'}
- Question 2: Focus on {selected_keywords[1] if len(selected_keywords) > 1 else 'timing'}
- Question 3: Focus on {selected_keywords[2] if len(selected_keywords) > 2 else 'structure'}
- Ensure questions explore DISTINCT dimensions of the problem

Guidelines:
- Questions should focus on operator-level differences
- Analyze specific operators used in each assertion
- Consider operator placement, precedence, and correctness
- Each question should identify specific operators that need attention
- IMPORTANT: Each question MUST focus on its assigned keyword aspect to ensure diversity

Keyword Guidance (match question number to keyword):
- logical_operators: Focus on &&, ||, !, and their usage in conditions
- temporal_operators: Analyze |-> vs |=>, ##[n:m], and timing constructs
- comparison_operators: Examine === vs ==, !== vs !=, and relational operators
- implication_operators: Distinguish between overlapping (|->) and non-overlapping (|=>) implications
- bitwise_operators: Consider &, |, ~, and reduction operators in signal operations

Constraints:
- Generate exactly {self.max_questions_per_level} questions
- Each question must end with "?"
- Questions should be concise (one sentence each)
- Each question must address a DIFFERENT keyword aspect (no overlap!)
- Avoid generating similar questions - maximize diversity across the {self.max_questions_per_level} aspects

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide questions as a numbered list:
1. [First question]
2. [Second question]
3. [Third question]

- Make the rule precise and unambiguous
- Prioritize the fix that would have the biggest impact

Rule Format Requirements:
- The rule must be one sentence
- Start the rule with "- "
- Be specific about the action needed
- Include a concrete example when helpful

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate exactly 1 rule.

Examples of good rules:
- Replace non-overlapping implication (|=>) with overlapping (|->) when checking immediate response
- Add missing enable signal to antecedent when the specification mentions conditional behavior
- Use && operator instead of || when multiple conditions must be satisfied simultaneously
